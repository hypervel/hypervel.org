## Introduction

When you start a new Laravel Hyperf project, error and exception handling is already configured for you. The `App\Exceptions\Handler` class is where all exceptions thrown by your application are logged and then rendered to the user. We'll dive deeper into this class throughout this documentation.

::: info
`App\Exceptions\Handler` is built on top of [Hyperf's ExceptionHandler](https://hyperf.wiki/#/en/exception-handler). Laravel Hyperf extends Hyperf's exception handler to migrate the most of features from Laravel's exception handler.
:::

## Configuration

The `debug` option in your `config/app.php` configuration file determines how much information about an error is actually displayed to the user. By default, this option is set to respect the value of the `APP_DEBUG` environment variable, which is stored in your `.env` file.

During local development, you should set the `APP_DEBUG` environment variable to `true`. **In your production environment, this value should always be `false`. If the value is set to `true` in production, you risk exposing sensitive configuration values to your application's end users.**

The `App\Exceptions\Handlers\ApiExceptionHandler` and `Hyperf\ExceptionHandler\Handler\WhoopsExceptionHandler` classes are the default exception handlers for `api` and `web requests respectively.

You can configure the exception handlers by modifying the `config/exceptions.php` file. In most cases, you don't need to change the default exception handlers.

```php
return [
    'handler' => [
        'http' => [
            App\Exceptions\Handlers\Handler::class,
        ],
    ],
];
```

::: warning
`report` feature replies on `report` method in `SwooleTW\Hyperf\Foundation\Exceptions\Contracts\ExceptionHandler`, if you are using custom exception handler, you need to implement the `report` method by yourself.

## Handling Exceptions

### Reporting Exceptions

In Laravel Hyperf, exception reporting is used to log exceptions or send them to an external service. By default, exceptions will be logged based on your [logging](/docs/logging.html) configuration. However, you are free to log exceptions however you wish.

If you need to report different types of exceptions in different ways, you may use the `reportable` method to register a closure that should be executed when an exception of a given type needs to be reported. Laravel will determine what type of exception the closure reports by examining the type-hint of the closure:

```php
use App\Exceptions\InvalidOrderException;

/**
 * Register the exception handling callbacks for the application.
 */
public function register(): void
{
    $this->reportable(function (InvalidOrderException $e) {
        // ...
    });
}
```

When you register a custom exception reporting callback using the `reportable` method, Laravel will still log the exception using the default logging configuration for the application. If you wish to stop the propagation of the exception to the default logging stack, you may use the `stop` method when defining your reporting callback or return `false` from the callback:

```php
$this->reportable(function (InvalidOrderException $e) {
    // ...
})->stop();

$this->reportable(function (InvalidOrderException $e) {
    return false;
});
```

::: note
To customize the exception reporting for a given exception, you may also utilize [reportable exceptions](/docs/errors.html#renderable-exceptions).
:::

#### Global Log Context

If available, Laravel Hyperf automatically adds the current user's ID to every exception's log message as contextual data. You may define your own global contextual data by defining a `context` method on your application's `App\Exceptions\Handler` class. This information will be included in every exception's log message written by your application:

```php
/**
 * Get the default context variables for logging.
 *
 * @return array<string, mixed>
 */
protected function context(): array
{
    return array_merge(parent::context(), [
        'foo' => 'bar',
    ]);
}
```

<a name="exception-log-context"></a>
#### Exception Log Context

While adding context to every log message can be useful, sometimes a particular exception may have unique context that you would like to include in your logs. By defining a `context` method on one of your application's exceptions, you may specify any data relevant to that exception that should be added to the exception's log entry:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Exceptions;

use Exception;

class InvalidOrderException extends Exception
{
    // ...

    /**
     * Get the exception's context information.
     *
     * @return array<string, mixed>
     */
    public function context(): array
    {
        return ['order_id' => $this->orderId];
    }
}
```

#### The `report` Helper

Sometimes you may need to report an exception but continue handling the current request. The `report` helper function allows you to quickly report an exception without rendering an error page to the user:

```php
public function isValid(string $value): bool
{
    try {
        // Validate the value...
    } catch (Throwable $e) {
        report($e);

        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Deduplicating Reported Exceptions

If you are using the `report` function throughout your application, you may occasionally report the same exception multiple times, creating duplicate entries in your logs.

If you would like to ensure that a single instance of an exception is only ever reported once, you may set the `$withoutDuplicates` property to `true` within your application's `App\Exceptions\Handler` class:

```php
namespace App\Exceptions;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Exceptions\Handler as ExceptionHandler;

class Handler extends ExceptionHandler
{
    /**
     * Indicates that an exception instance should only be reported once.
     *
     * @var bool
     */
    protected $withoutDuplicates = true;

    // ...
}
```

Now, when the `report` helper is called with the same instance of an exception, only the first call will be reported:

```php
$original = new RuntimeException('Whoops!');

report($original); // reported

try {
    throw $original;
} catch (Throwable $caught) {
    report($caught); // ignored
}

report($original); // ignored
report($caught); // ignored
```

### Exception Log Levels

When messages are written to your application's [logs](/docs/logging.html), the messages are written at a specified [log level](/docs/logging.html#log-levels), which indicates the severity or importance of the message being logged.

As noted above, even when you register a custom exception reporting callback using the `reportable` method, Laravel Hyperf will still log the exception using the default logging configuration for the application; however, since the log level can sometimes influence the channels on which a message is logged, you may wish to configure the log level that certain exceptions are logged at.

To accomplish this, you may define a `$levels` property on your application's exception handler. This property should contain an array of exception types and their associated log levels:

```php
use PDOException;
use Psr\Log\LogLevel;

/**
 * A list of exception types with their corresponding custom log levels.
 *
 * @var array<class-string<\Throwable>, \Psr\Log\LogLevel::*>
 */
protected $levels = [
    PDOException::class => LogLevel::CRITICAL,
];
```

### Ignoring Exceptions by Type

When building your application, there will be some types of exceptions you never want to report. To ignore these exceptions, define a `$dontReport` property on your application's exception handler. Any classes that you add to this property will never be reported; however, they may still have custom rendering logic:

```php
use App\Exceptions\InvalidOrderException;

/**
 * A list of the exception types that are not reported.
 *
 * @var array<int, class-string<\Throwable>>
 */
protected $dontReport = [
    InvalidOrderException::class,
];
```

Internally, Laravel Hyperf already ignores some types of errors for you, such as exceptions resulting from 404 HTTP errors or 403 HTTP responses generated by auth exceptions. If you would like to instruct Laravel Hyperf to stop ignoring a given type of exception, you may invoke the `stopIgnoring` method within your exception handler's `register` method:

```php
use Hyperf\HttpMessage\Exception\HttpException;

/**
 * Register the exception handling callbacks for the application.
 */
public function register(): void
{
    $this->stopIgnoring(HttpException::class);

    // ...
}
```

### Rendering Exceptions

By default, the Laravel Hyperf exception handler will convert exceptions into an HTTP response for you. However, you are free to register a custom rendering closure for exceptions of a given type. You may accomplish this by invoking the `renderable` method within your exception handler.

The closure passed to the `renderable` method should return an instance of `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface`, which may be generated via the `response` helper. Laravel Hyperf will determine what type of exception the closure renders by examining the type-hint of the closure:

```php
use App\Exceptions\InvalidOrderException;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

/**
 * Register the exception handling callbacks for the application.
 */
public function register(): void
{
    $this->renderable(function (InvalidOrderException $e, Request $request) {
        return response()->view('errors.invalid-order', [], 500);
    });
}
```

You may also use the `renderable` method to override the rendering behavior for built-in Laravel Hypperf or Hyperf exceptions such as `NotFoundHttpException`. If the closure given to the `renderable` method does not return a value, Laravel's default exception rendering will be utilized:

```php
use SwooleTW\Hyperf\Http\Request;
use SwooleTW\Hyperf\HttpMessage\Exceptions\NotFoundHttpException;

/**
 * Register the exception handling callbacks for the application.
 */
public function register(): void
{
    $this->renderable(function (NotFoundHttpException $e, Request $request) {
        if ($request->is('api/*')) {
            return response()->json([
                'message' => 'Record not found.'
            ], 404);
        }
    });
}
```

#### Rendering Exceptions as JSON

When rendering an exception, Laravel Hyperf will automatically determine if the exception should be rendered as an HTML or JSON response based on the `Accept` header of the request. If you would like to customize how Laravel Hyperf determines whether to render HTML or JSON exception responses, you may utilize the `shouldRenderJsonWhen` method:

```php
use SwooleTW\Hyperf\Http\Request;
use SwooleTW\Hyperf\HttpMessage\Exceptions\NotFoundHttpException;

/**
 * Register the exception handling callbacks for the application.
 */
public function register(): void
{
    $this->shouldRenderJsonWhen(function (Request $request, Throwable $e) {
        return $request->is('admin/*');
    });
}
```

#### Customizing the Exception Response

Rarely, you may need to customize the entire HTTP response rendered by Laravel Hyperf's exception handler. To accomplish this, you may register a response customization closure using the `respondUsing` method:

```php
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use SwooleTW\Hyperf\Http\Request;
use SwooleTW\Hyperf\HttpMessage\Exceptions\NotFoundHttpException;

/**
 * Register the exception handling callbacks for the application.
 */
public function register(): void
{
    $this->respondUsing(function (ResponseInterface $response, Throwable $e, Request $request) {
        if ($response->getStatusCode() === 419) {
            return response()->json([
                'code' => 419,
                'message' => 'The page expired, please try again.',
            ]);
        }

        return $response;
    });
}
```

### Reportable and Renderable Exceptions

Instead of defining custom reporting and rendering behavior in your exception handler's `register` method, you may define `report` and `render` methods directly on your application's exceptions. When these methods exist, they will automatically be called by the framework:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Exceptions;

use Exception;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Http\Response;

class InvalidOrderException extends Exception
{
    /**
     * Report the exception.
     */
    public function report(): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * Render the exception into an HTTP response.
     */
    public function render(Request $request): Response
    {
        return response(/* ... */);
    }
}
```

If your exception extends an exception that is already renderable, such as a built-in Laravel Hyperf or Hyperf exception, you may return `false` from the exception's `render` method to render the exception's default HTTP response:

```php
/**
 * Render the exception into an HTTP response.
 */
public function render(Request $request): ResponseInterface|bool
{
    if (/** Determine if the exception needs custom rendering */) {

        return response(/* ... */);
    }

    return false;
}
```

If your exception contains custom reporting logic that is only necessary when certain conditions are met, you may need to instruct Laravel Hyperf to sometimes report the exception using the default exception handling configuration. To accomplish this, you may return `false` from the exception's `report` method:

```php
/**
 * Report the exception.
 */
public function report(): bool
{
    if (/** Determine if the exception needs custom reporting */) {

        // ...

        return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```

::: note
You may type-hint any required dependencies of the `report` method and they will automatically be injected into the method by Laravel Hyperf's [service container](/docs/container.html).
:::

## HTTP Exceptions

Some exceptions describe HTTP error codes from the server. For example, this may be a "page not found" error (404), an "unauthorized error" (401), or even a developer generated 500 error. In order to generate such a response from anywhere in your application, you may use the `abort` helper:

```php
abort(404);
```

### Custom HTTP Error Pages

Laravel Hyperf makes it easy to display custom error pages for various HTTP status codes. For example, to customize the error page for 404 HTTP status codes, create a `resources/views/errors/404.blade.php` view template. This view will be rendered for all 404 errors generated by your application. The views within this directory should be named to match the HTTP status code they correspond to. The `SwooleTW\Hyperf\HttpMessage\Exceptions\HttpException` instance raised by the `abort` function will be passed to the view as an `$exception` variable:

```html
<h2>{{ $exception->getMessage() }}</h2>
```

#### Fallback HTTP Error Pages

You may also define a "fallback" error page for a given series of HTTP status codes. This page will be rendered if there is not a corresponding page for the specific HTTP status code that occurred. To accomplish this, define a `4xx.blade.php` template and a `5xx.blade.php` template in your application's `resources/views/errors` directory.

## Whoops Exception Renderer

You can use [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) as an alternative exception renderer in debug mode. You can bind your own renderer to the `SwooleTW\Hyperf\Foundation\Exceptions\Contracts\ExceptionRenderer` contract in your `AppServiceProvider` class.

```php
$this->app->bind(
    \SwooleTW\Hyperf\Foundation\Exceptions\Contracts\ExceptionRenderer::class,
    \SwooleTW\Hyperf\Foundation\Exceptions\WhoopsErrorRenderer::class
);
```

You can also implement your own renderer by implementing the `SwooleTW\Hyperf\Foundation\Exceptions\Contracts\ExceptionRenderer` contract.
