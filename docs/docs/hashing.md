# Hashing
[[toc]]

## Introduction

The Laravel Hyperf `Hash` [facade](/docs/facades) provides secure Bcrypt and Argon2 hashing for storing user passwords.

Bcrypt is a great choice for hashing passwords because its "work factor" is adjustable, which means that the time it takes to generate a hash can be increased as hardware power increases. When hashing passwords, slow is good. The longer an algorithm takes to hash a password, the longer it takes malicious users to generate "rainbow tables" of all possible string hash values that may be used in brute force attacks against applications.

## Configuration

By default, Laravel Hyperf uses the `bcrypt` hashing driver when hashing data. However, several other hashing drivers are supported, including [`argon`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) and [`argon2id`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2).

You may specify your application's hashing driver using the `HASH_DRIVER` environment variable. But, if you want to customize all of Laravel Hyperf's hashing driver options, you should publish the complete `hashing` configuration file using the `vendor:publish` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish hashing
```

## Basic Usage

### Hashing Passwords

You may hash a password by calling the `make` method on the `Hash` facade:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use LaravelHyperf\Http\Request;
use LaravelHyperf\Support\Facades\Hash;

class PasswordController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Update the password for the user.
     */
    public function update(Request $request): ResponseInterface
    {
        // Validate the new password length...

        $request->user()->fill([
            'password' => Hash::make($request->newPassword)
        ])->save();

        return redirect('/profile');
    }
}
```

#### Adjusting The Bcrypt Work Factor

If you are using the Bcrypt algorithm, the `make` method allows you to manage the work factor of the algorithm using the `rounds` option; however, the default work factor managed by Laravel Hyperf is acceptable for most applications:

```php
$hashed = Hash::make('password', [
    'rounds' => 12,
]);
```

#### Adjusting The Argon2 Work Factor

If you are using the Argon2 algorithm, the `make` method allows you to manage the work factor of the algorithm using the `memory`, `time`, and `threads` options; however, the default values managed by Laravel Hyperf are acceptable for most applications:

```php
$hashed = Hash::make('password', [
    'memory' => 1024,
    'time' => 2,
    'threads' => 2,
]);
```

::: note
For more information on these options, please refer to the [official PHP documentation regarding Argon hashing](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php).

### Verifying That a Password Matches a Hash

The `check` method provided by the `Hash` facade allows you to verify that a given plain-text string corresponds to a given hash:

```php
if (Hash::check('plain-text', $hashedPassword)) {
    // The passwords match...
}
```

### Determining if a Password Needs to be Rehashed

The `needsRehash` method provided by the `Hash` facade allows you to determine if the work factor used by the hasher has changed since the password was hashed. Some applications choose to perform this check during the application's authentication process:

```php
if (Hash::needsRehash($hashed)) {
    $hashed = Hash::make('plain-text');
}
```
