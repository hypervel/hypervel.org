# HTTP Tests
[[toc]]

## Introduction

Laravel Hyperf provides a very fluent API for making HTTP requests to your application and examining the output. For example, take a look at the feature test defined below:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use LaravelHyperf\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
use LaravelHyperf\Foundation\Testing\WithoutMiddleware;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * A basic test example.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function testBasicTest()
    {
        $response = $this->get('/');

        $response->assertStatus(200);

    }
}
```

The `get` method makes a `GET` request into the application, while the `assertStatus` method asserts that the returned response should have the given HTTP status code. In addition to this simple assertion, Laravel Hyperf also contains a variety of assertions for inspecting the response headers, content, JSON structure, and more.

### Customizing Request Headers

You may use the `withHeaders` method to customize the request's headers before it is sent to the application. This allows you to add any custom headers you would like to the request:

```php
    <?php

    class ExampleTest extends TestCase
    {
        /**
         * A basic functional test example.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function testBasicExample()
        {
            $response = $this->withHeaders([
                'X-Header' => 'Value',
            ])->json('POST', '/user', ['name' => 'Sally']);

            $response
                ->assertStatus(201)
                ->assertJson([
                    'created' => true,
                ]);
        }
    }
```

::: tip
The CSRF middleware is automatically disabled when running tests.

### Cookies

You may use the `withCookie` or `withCookies` methods to set cookie values before making a request. The `withCookie` method accepts a cookie name and value as its two arguments, while the `withCookies` method accepts an array of name / value pairs:

```php
<?php

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testCookies()
    {
        $response = $this->withCookie('color', 'blue')->get('/');

        $response = $this->withCookies([
            'color' => 'blue',
            'name' => 'Taylor',
        ])->get('/');
    }
}
```

### Debugging Responses

After making a test request to your application, the `dump`, `dumpHeaders`, and `dumpSession` methods may be used to examine and debug the response contents:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use LaravelHyperf\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
use LaravelHyperf\Foundation\Testing\WithoutMiddleware;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * A basic test example.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function testBasicTest()
    {
        $response = $this->get('/');

        $response->dumpHeaders();

        $response->dumpSession();

        $response->dump();
    }
}
```

## Session / Authentication

Laravel Hyperf provides several helpers for working with the session during HTTP testing. First, you may set the session data to a given array using the `withSession` method. This is useful for loading the session with data before issuing a request to your application:

```php
<?php

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testApplication()
    {
        $response = $this->withSession(['foo' => 'bar'])
            ->get('/');
    }
}
```

One common use of the session is for maintaining state for the authenticated user. The `actingAs` helper method provides a simple way to authenticate a given user as the current user. For example, we may use a [model factory](/docs/database-testing#writing-factories) to generate and authenticate a user:

```php
<?php

use App\User;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testApplication()
    {
        $user = factory(User::class)->create();

        $response = $this->actingAs($user)
            ->withSession(['foo' => 'bar'])
            ->get('/');
    }
}
```

You may also specify which guard should be used to authenticate the given user by passing the guard name as the second argument to the `actingAs` method:

```php
$this->actingAs($user, 'api')
```

## Testing JSON APIs

Laravel Hyperf also provides several helpers for testing JSON APIs and their responses. For example, the `json`, `getJson`, `postJson`, `putJson`, `patchJson`, `deleteJson`, and `optionsJson` methods may be used to issue JSON requests with various HTTP verbs. You may also easily pass data and headers to these methods. To get started, let's write a test to make a `POST` request to `/user` and assert that the expected data was returned:

```php
<?php

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * A basic functional test example.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function testBasicExample()
    {
        $response = $this->postJson('/user', ['name' => 'Sally']);

        $response
            ->assertStatus(201)
            ->assertJson([
                'created' => true,
            ]);
    }
}
```

::: tip
The `assertJson` method converts the response to an array and utilizes `PHPUnit::assertArraySubset` to verify that the given array exists within the JSON response returned by the application. So, if there are other properties in the JSON response, this test will still pass as long as the given fragment is present.
:::

In addition, JSON response data may be accessed as array variables on the response:

```php
$this->assertTrue($response['created']);
```

### Verifying An Exact JSON Match

If you would like to verify that the given array is an **exact** match for the JSON returned by the application, you should use the `assertExactJson` method:

```php
<?php

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * A basic functional test example.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function testBasicExample()
    {
        $response = $this->json('POST', '/user', ['name' => 'Sally']);

        $response
            ->assertStatus(201)
            ->assertExactJson([
                'created' => true,
            ]);
    }
}
```

### Verifying JSON Paths

If you would like to verify that the JSON response contains some given data at a specified path, you should use the `assertJsonPath` method:

```php
<?php

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * A basic functional test example.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function testBasicExample()
    {
        $response = $this->json('POST', '/user', ['name' => 'Sally']);

        $response
            ->assertStatus(201)
            ->assertJsonPath('team.owner.name', 'foo')
    }
}
```

## Testing File Uploads

The `LaravelHyperf\Http\UploadedFile` class provides a `fake` method which may be used to generate dummy files or images for testing. This, combined with the `Storage` facade's `fake` method greatly simplifies the testing of file uploads. For example, you may combine these two features to easily test an avatar upload form:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use LaravelHyperf\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
use LaravelHyperf\Foundation\Testing\WithoutMiddleware;
use LaravelHyperf\Http\UploadedFile;
use LaravelHyperf\Support\Facades\Storage;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testAvatarUpload()
    {
        Storage::fake('avatars');

        $file = UploadedFile::fake()->image('avatar.jpg');

        $response = $this->json('POST', '/avatar', [
            'avatar' => $file,
        ]);

        // Assert the file was stored...
        Storage::disk('avatars')->assertExists($file->hashName());

        // Assert a file does not exist...
        Storage::disk('avatars')->assertMissing('missing.jpg');
    }
}
```

#### Fake File Customization

When creating files using the `fake` method, you may specify the width, height, and size of the image in order to better test your validation rules:

```php
UploadedFile::fake()->image('avatar.jpg', $width, $height)->size(100);
```

In addition to creating images, you may create files of any other type using the `create` method:

```php
UploadedFile::fake()->create('document.pdf', $sizeInKilobytes);
```

If needed, you may pass a `$mimeType` argument to the method to explicitly define the MIME type that should be returned by the file:

```php
UploadedFile::fake()->create('document.pdf', $sizeInKilobytes, 'application/pdf');
```

## Available Assertions

### Response Assertions

Laravel Hyperf provides a variety of custom assertion methods for your [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) feature tests. These assertions may be accessed on the response that is returned from the `json`, `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` test methods:
